If you absolutely can't stand them, you can put them in an empty tea bag, tie it up, and take it out before you serve the dish. But honestly, I've never had anyone complain! This meal is great for entertaining or for a cozy dinner for two. I suggest serving it with a simple spinach salad and some good Italian bread.",

Once the egg whites are almost set, turn on your broiler to high and set a baking rack in the middle of the oven.",

Stir in 2 cups of the flour with the mixer on low speed until it's all mixed in. The dough will be very soft.",

Push the flat sides of a light and a dark dough ball together to make one bigger ball, then flatten it into a disk that is half dark and half light. Cut this disk in half with a knife, cutting straight across the seam where the two doughs meet. Flip one of the halves over, then firmly press the halves back together. You should now have a disk with 4 alternating colored sections. Do this for all the leftover dough. Put the cookies on the baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between them. Sprinkle flaky sea salt on top.",
      "Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the cookie edges start to look golden brown. Let them cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. Then, move them to a wire rack to cool down completely."

    "title": "Quick Sorghum Flour Crepes (Gluten-Free)",
    "description": "I truly enjoy crepes, but since I can't eat gluten, I thought I'd never have them again. Luckily, the first crepes were made with buckwheat flour, which doesn't have gluten. I like those, but they need to sit overnight. As a mom with little kids, I often need something fast. So, I tried using sweet white sorghum flour instead. It made a light batter that held its shape well and had a soft feel and mild taste. These are great for either sweet or savory crepes. You can fill them with things like ham and cheese, chicken with your favorite sauce, smoked salmon, strips of beef, vegetables, eggs, or even fruit and yogurt. Use whatever you like!",

Cook this until the top looks dry and the edges start to come up from the pan, which takes 2 to 4 minutes. Turn it over and cook for just a few more seconds on the second side. Move the cooked crepe to a plate. Keep doing this with the rest of the batter to make around 8 crepes."

Using organic vegetables will make the soup a beautiful color and give it a richer taste. Most people won't even realize you've used coconut milk instead of heavy cream, making it not only tasty but also packed with the health benefits of coconut. You can serve it with a spoonful of plain Greek yogurt, some chopped parsley, or a drizzle of good quality, cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil. Enjoy the vibrant, golden color!",

    "description": "This well-known Thai dish offers a great mix of spicy, sweet, salty, and sour flavors. Our recipe is like the traditional Bangkok version, not overly saucy like many restaurant dishes you might find in the West. Every bite is packed with flavor, lightly coated in a delicious sauce. Serve with lime wedges, fish sauce, sugar, white pepper or chili flakes, and vinegar on the side so everyone can adjust the taste to their liking.",

      "Poke each potato several times with a fork. Cook them in the microwave on high for about 9 minutes, or follow your microwave's directions. Once they are soft, carefully move them to a cutting board and slice each potato in half. Let them cool down.",
      "While the potatoes cook in the microwave, begin preparing the sausage. Put the sausage in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Break it up into small pieces and stir it sometimes. Cook until it's no longer pink, which takes about 10 minutes.",
      "As the sausage cooks, chop all your vegetables and herbs. Coarsely chop the spinach. Finely chop the cilantro. Slice the green onions and keep the white parts separate from the green tops.",
      "When the sausage is almost done, crack the eggs into a medium bowl. Whisk in ¼ teaspoon of black pepper, the garlic powder, and chili powder. Keep whisking until the egg whites and yolks are fully mixed, about 15 seconds.",
      "Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pour in the eggs. Cook, stirring now and then, for about 5 minutes. Stir in the spinach and cook just until the eggs are done and the spinach starts to wilt, for 1 or 2 more minutes.",
      "While the eggs cook, you can start on the potatoes. Roughly chop the potatoes (leave the skins on) and put them in a medium bowl. Stir in the white parts of the green onions, half of the chopped cilantro, the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the remaining ¼ teaspoon of black pepper, and the sea salt. Mix these ingredients into the potatoes, making sure the potatoes stay in chunky pieces.",
      "To put the bowls together, arrange equal amounts of potatoes, eggs, and sausage in each of 4 bowls. Crumble the cotija cheese and sprinkle an equal amount over each bowl. Divide the rest of the cilantro and the green parts of the green onions, sprinkling them into each bowl. Add your favorite toppings and serve."

Stir almost all the time to make the rice release its starch and create a creamy sauce. Be careful not to let the rice stick or sizzle on the pot's bottom.",

Continue heating and stirring until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Adding and stirring in all the broth should take about 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "Add the shrimp, parsley, lemon zest, and the last tablespoon of butter. Cook and stir until the rice is soft and the shrimp turns pink and firm, but still tender, which takes about 5 minutes. The risotto should be loose and creamy when it's done."

    "title": "Fried Bread Tacos with Zesty Shredded Beef",
    "description": "This recipe puts a different spin on regular tacos. It uses a light, puffy bread that is fried, then filled with creamy refried beans, beef that's been slow-cooked until tender and spicy, and classic toppings like shredded cheese, lettuce, salsa, and sour cream. Most of the time spent cooking is hands-off, thanks to the slow cooker. You can have this meal ready to eat in about 30 minutes once you start frying the bread.",

Put the shredded beef back into the slow cooker. Keep cooking on High for about 1 hour so the flavors blend well. Pour off any extra liquid.",

      "Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or a big saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). The oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep. Fry each dough round until both sides are golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes per side.",
      "Warm up 1/4 cup of olive oil in a small pot. Add the pinto beans, 1 tablespoon of chili powder, 1 teaspoon of cumin, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Stir and mash the beans until they are hot, which takes about 5 minutes.",

The split peas, which I didn't care for much before, magically give it the thickness, color, and flavor that usually comes from a roux, cooked peppers and celery, gumbo file powder, and rice — but without needing any of those things. It tastes even better the next day as the peas continue to break down and make the broth thicker.",

Smoking meat takes a whole day, but it's really worth the time spent! I like to use different kinds of wood chips, like maple, apple, and bourbon barrel. Eat it with your favorite sauce.",

Moisten the inside edge to make it stick shut. Do this for all the remaining cheese mixture and wrappers.",
      "Warm the oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a big pot. You need enough oil so that an egg roll will be covered at least three-quarters of the way when you put it in. Once the oil is hot, add 2 or 3 egg rolls at a time, turning them often so they brown evenly. Fry them until they are a deep golden brown. Take them out as soon as you hear a louder frying sound, which means the oil has reached the cheese. Serve them hot."
